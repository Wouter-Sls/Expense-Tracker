# Expense tracker

This application is to track your expenses.

The user can view all their expenses on the home page and a graph is displayed to show the expenses per category (Food, Work, Leisure and Travel). The user can also create new expenses by filling in the title, amount, date and category. The overview on the homepage is then automatically updated.

During this project I worked with many new widgets and features. 
For example: handling user input with TextField and DropdownButton, show a text to alert the user by using showDialog() funtion, use a ListView to show all the expenses, set light and dark mode settings, use MediaQuery or LayoutBuilder to render parts of the UI conditionally, show different code based on which platform you are running.
